Basic Python

########## WORKING ######################
This Iron_Gym application was developed by me for performing the CRUD Operations. CRUD - Create, Read, Update and Delete Operations for a GYM. This is one of the assignment that I did for my EDYODA Certification Exam. 

There are 2 types of user designed on this application. One is the Super-User (Admin) and others are Members. The basic functionalities that I have given to the Admins are Create a new member, update member's membership, make a regime for a member, delete member from the list, view the details of any member, etc. The members have some functionalities like they can see their regime, they can see their profile, etc. The good thing about this project is, I have not used any kind of database here in making this application. All the parts where the storage of details like usernames, passwords, regimes, etc are done with the help of basic python data types like Lists, dicts, etc.

This is a very simple command line project, it does'nt have any GUIs.
